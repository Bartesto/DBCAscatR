The goal of ScatMatch is to provide a range of functions and visualisations to 
assist in cleaning and filtering SNP genotype data from non-invasively collected 
samples (e.g. scats) and to cluster samples into groups to identify source 
individuals. Functions are also provided to summarise and map individual capture 
histories.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/bartesto) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bartesto/ScatMatch")
```
## Help Files

All functions within ScatMatch have the usual R help files, however the best place to see these and some helpful articles describing the intended workflow is the [ScatMatch website](https://bartesto.github.io/ScatMatch/index.html)

\title{Data "missingness" plot}
\usage{
miss_hist()
}
\value{
It will write to jpg file a histogram of NA proportions for the loci.
}
\description{
\code{miss_hist} creates a histogram of the proportion missing data (NA) per locus.
}
\details{
When run it uses the "loci_NA.csv", an output
    from running \code{\link{amp_threshold}}, to produce a histogram to aid in
    visualising data "missingness".

    The plot is printed to screen and also saved as a jpg file to
    the `results/threshold/` sub-directory. It can be used to determine a
    "missingness" threshold for further data cleaning.
